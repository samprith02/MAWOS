"""P3 — PCN-style provenance gate (RQ2, docs/RESEARCH_PLAN_V3.md §3.2).

A deterministic extract-and-match check on the LLM tier's free-text
answers: every numeric token in the answer must trace back to a number
that actually appears in the JSON payload of the tool call(s) made for
that same query (or to one of MAWOS's own fixed institutional-policy
constants, e.g. the 75% attendance threshold — those are real values the
system is entitled to state, not hallucinations). This is an engineering
gate, not a novelty claim — the mechanism is PCN-style (Proof-Carrying
Numbers, arXiv 2509.06902) — and it exists to catch the LLM inventing a
number the tools never returned.

H2 (§3.2): "a deterministic extract-and-match gate reduces ungrounded
numeric claims at acceptable false-block and latency cost." Falsified if
false-block rate degrades usable answers, or claims escape by paraphrase.
`evaluation/gate_p3.py` measures both on the dev split — see that file's
docstring for why this is a dev-only, not-yet-confirmed engineering
result, same caveat P4's tau carries.

Only the LLM tier is gated, and only turns where at least one tool was
called — the lexicon tier's answers are formatted directly from tool
output (`orchestrator._FORMATTERS`) and are grounded by construction, and
a turn with zero tool calls has nothing to check a claim against.

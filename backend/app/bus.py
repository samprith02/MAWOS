"""In-process publish/subscribe event bus with full instrumentation.

Semantically equivalent to Redis pub/sub (topic -> subscribers), but runs
inside the single MAWOS process so the whole system needs zero external
infrastructure. Every hop is persisted to `workflow_events`, which is what
makes cross-agent propagation latency a *measured* quantity rather than a
claim.

A `workflow_id` is attached to the first publish of a cascade and carried
through every downstream event, so a 7-agent chain can be reconstructed
and timed end-to-end from the audit table.

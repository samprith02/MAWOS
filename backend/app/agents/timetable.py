"""Timetable Agent — objective-driven weekly timetable generation.

Hard constraints (never violated):
  * a faculty member cannot be in two sections at the same (day, period),
    checked GLOBALLY across all 40 sections and against any bookings
    outside the scope being regenerated;
  * one section has at most one class per (day, period);
  * each subject receives exactly `credits` periods per week — placement
    rate is 1.000 or the solve is rejected.

Soft objective (minimised): idle gaps inside a day, days that do not
start at first period, uneven daily load, a subject taught twice in one
day, and teacher idle gaps. Weights and definitions live in
`evaluation/benchmark/schedule_metrics`, frozen at P0.

Algorithm: compact greedy seed + simulated annealing (`app/scheduler.py`).

**This replaces the v2 randomised-greedy solver**, which enforced the hard
constraints and nothing else — it had no objective function, so a
timetable with holes at 09:00 and 12:15 scored exactly as well as a
compact one. Measured over 10 seeds on the shipped institution, v2 left
80.8 of 200 section-days starting after first period and 223 idle gaps
inside days. The before/after is `evaluation/scheduler_eval.py` and
`results/v3_scheduler/e4.md`; the v2 solver is preserved verbatim and
still runnable at `evaluation/baselines/scheduler_v2.py`.

Scheduling is **not** claimed as a research contribution — simulated
annealing for timetabling is decades old and the plan (§4.4) retracted
it. What is claimed is a measured before/after on a real defect.

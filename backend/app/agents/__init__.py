"""Agent registry v3 — P2 (docs/RESEARCH_PLAN_V3.md §7): 4 components meet
the pre-registered agent criterion (own state/policy that outlives a
request, act on events without direct invocation) — Orchestrator,
Attendance, Eligibility, Scheduling. The rest of this registry still holds
Academic, Admission, Finance, Placement and Notification, because tools.py
and the REST routes need somewhere to call into for records, workflows and
alerts — they are tool-backed components (or, for Notification, a bus
subscriber), not agents, and CORE_AGENTS below is what "4 agents" means in
code rather than only in prose.

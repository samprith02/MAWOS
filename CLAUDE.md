# MAWOS — working notes for Claude

B.E. final-year research prototype (Dept. of AI&ML, MITE, Group 12).
Framing: **event-driven multi-agent workflow orchestration engine for
universities**. The contribution is the orchestration engine, not the agent
count. Ten agents, chosen by institutional function.

## Run it

```bash
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Ollama\ollama.exe serve     # FIRST — portable install, not a service
python run.py                              # -> http://localhost:8000
```

`llm.py` caches the Ollama availability check at startup, so the header badge
only flips to `AI · LLM` if Ollama was already serving when MAWOS booted.
Without it the system still works — the deterministic tier takes over and the
badge says so.

Logins: `4MT23AI049`/`student123`, `aiml.f02`/`faculty123`, `hod.aiml`/
`faculty123`, `principal`/`principal123`, `admin`/`admin123`.

## Rules that matter here

- **Never headline a 100% figure.** Anywhere. This project was rebuilt
  specifically because v1 looked too clean to be real.
- **Report results in the direction the data points.** The LLM currently
  *loses* the routing comparison (70.4% vs 89.8%). That is written up as
  measured in README, ARCHITECTURE and RESULTS.md. Do not quietly re-frame it
  as a win, and do not delete the losing configuration from the report.
- **Never present a number you cannot regenerate** from `evaluation/`.
- Label attendance accuracy as *deterministic verification*, never "AI
  accuracy"; label the manual-workflow comparison as a *modeled estimate*.
- Design decisions in the docs are deliberate viva defences. Don't casually
  change them — if something looks wrong, say so rather than silently
  "fixing" it.

## Gotchas that have cost real time

- **Stop the server before deleting `mawos.db`.** A running server holds the
  file, so `Remove-Item -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` fails *silently* and
  leaves a contaminated DB. Reseed helper: `scratchpad/reseed.py`.
- **Don't run `evaluate.py` while the server is up** — both write the same
  SQLite file.
- **Shipped DB state is deliberate**: 400 submitted applications, 0 verified,
  so the admissions pipeline can be demoed live. Don't consume it by running
  verify/merit/allot against the shipped DB.
- **Cascade latency is not comparable across runs** with and without Ollama
  resident: ~127 ms idle vs ~466 ms with a 2 GB model loaded. The cascade path
  never calls the LLM; it is pure resource contention. State the condition.
- **Installing Ollama on this laptop**: `winget install Ollama.Ollama` hangs
  after downloading (blocks on a UAC prompt that can't appear in a
  non-interactive shell), and its temp file is preallocated to full size so it
  looks complete while still downloading — a mid-flight copy matches the
  remote byte-for-byte but fails `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` with
  `HashMismatch`. Use the portable zip instead; verify the signature.

## Evaluation

```bash
python -m pytest tests -q                 # 12 tests
python evaluation/evaluate.py             # both routing tiers when Ollama is up
python evaluation/evaluate.py --no-llm    # skip the 108 live LLM calls
python evaluation/ablation.py             # is the architecture load-bearing?
python evaluation/failure_injection.py    # fault isolation + replay
python evaluation/scalability.py          # constant workload vs institution size
```

`evaluate.py::_verdict` derives §1.3's conclusion from the *sign* of the
measured deltas, so the report cannot claim the LLM helps when it doesn't.
Keep it that way.

## Known weak points (say these before an examiner does)

- The 108-query routing benchmark and the keyword lexicon it scores were
  written by the same project, so the lexicon is tuned to these phrasings.
  It is evidence about this classifier on this benchmark, not a general
  claim. A held-out set written outside the team is the fix.
- The LLM tier is one model (`qwen2.5:3b-instruct`), one temperature, one
  pass — no seed sweep, no confidence intervals. A 7B/14B model may reverse
  the result; `MAWOS_OLLAMA_MODEL` switches it with no code change.
- Data is synthetic (UCI-calibrated, copula, 3% label noise), the bus is
  in-process and at-most-once, and replay recovery is manual.
